# Working:
* This project focuses on determining the optimal path between a given start and end point on a map. Along the route, there may be multiple intermediate waypoints. These waypoints are prioritized based on their proximity to the starting pointâ€”the nearest waypoint is visited first, followed by the next closest, continuing in this manner until the destination is reached.
